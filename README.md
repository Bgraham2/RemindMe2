The app allows users to set reminders for repetitive tasks.

1/24/2019 - Testing on a phone.


1/25/2019 - found bugs. Creates past notifications,
                        No LED on notification, Possible issue no vibration,
                        Fab and save button create new activities instead of switching. So if multiple remiders are added it will open a                           number of screens.
                        
2/1/2019 - Notifiactions stop repeating after a time. Need to change font to better fit the layout. Will need to change color scheme to something easier on the eyes.
